### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I might have felt a little unprepared for the database and the endpoints, because i feel i would've learned better if we 
would have looked more into prisma for example, but overall y did manage to find the way to do it just by looking into documentation 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I actually liked how it ended up, maybe add more styling, but in general it works as i intended to so in particular theres nothing else i would've like to add 
other than some interaction by styling 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

This time i felt more confident recording my demo but i think i still need to have a little more enthusiasm when im doing it 
so i can catch the attention of the viewer

### Open-source libraries used

- Used react-router and prisma 

### Shout out
